# Learn&Share
Learn&Share is an innovative skill-sharing platform where anyone can become both a student and a teacher, regardless of formal education. We believe everyone has valuable skills and create a safe space where people can monetize their abilities or share them for free as volunteers. What makes us unique is that we don't limit skill categories â€“ from traditional to unusual, each mentor can propose their own teaching category. We prioritize user safety through mandatory video verification for mentors, while teaching quality is confirmed by real student reviews. Learn&Share isn't just an app, it's a social project and vibrant community aimed at developing public communications and accessible education for all. Join us to explore new horizons in learning and teaching
